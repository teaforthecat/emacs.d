REQUIREMENTS
------------

emacs >= 24.2 

DESCRIPTION
------------ 

The keybindings follow the IJKL movement pattern, they are inspired by
ErgoEmacs' keybindings. They are set for the dvorak layout. The
editing commands like kill-word and yank are done with the left hand
while the movement commands are done with the right. The intent is to
have the most effecient motions possible, balancing movement and
editing between left and right hands. There is a global
movement-minor-mode in my-keybindings.el so other modes do not stomp
on the most basic movement bindings.


INSTALLATION
------------

el-get takes care of everything as long as the directory is named ~/.emacs.d


teaforthecat/emacs.d
