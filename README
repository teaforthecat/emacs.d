REQUIREMENTS
------------

el-get

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Many settings that have been broken up into files by application

INSTALLATION
------------

Copy all the files to ~/.emacs.d directory


USAGE
-----

The keybindings extend ErgoEmacs' keybindings which means it follows the IJKL movement pattern.
The editing commands like kill-word and yank are done with the left hand while the movement commands 
are done with the right. The intent in to have the most effecient motions possible, recognizing that 
rarely does one create text without removing text. They are treated as yin and yang, though it seems 
that I tend to use my right hand(movement) more than my left(edit).


TODO
----

Figure out good wl settings, the wl branch with imap support seems to be the best option
